**CHALLENGE TITLE: API Interaction - api_interaction.py**

**PURPOSE OF PROJECT:**Using http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com and Python get the 200
most recent TODOs, create a TODO, and delete a TODO given an ID. 

**VERSION or DATE:** 6/14/2018

**HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:** Run script in IDE or text editor of choosing to see 200 most recent TODOs taken from jsonplaceholder;
a TODO created, and a TODO deleted

### NOTE
6/14/2018 9:40 PM added **api_interaction_two_another_way.py**
This was added due to my lack of clarity pertaining to the nature of the challenge. This py script deals with the TODOs a little 
differently. I work with the dictionary more as a whole and print it to stdout as well. I delete a TODO from the list and then 
create a new one and tack it on the end, I then POST it.

_I apologize I am also still working on learning API usage._
